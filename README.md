Hello my name is Mobin Mohammadi I am General Physican who is into coding and I am obsessed with AI in healthcare, also like gaming and I'm kind of game developer(amature)
made this github account while I was in medschool because I thought that I had to develpe apps to make my life better but I didn't have any progress until 2020.
The year of 2020 was the best year of my life (beside COVID-19) I learned a lot, my confident level rose so that year developed my first app which I coded in python.
I used to learn many programming language but didn't stuck to it, So I'm here to be more productive.
PLEASE E-MAIL ME IF YOU CAN HELP ME WITH MY PROJECTS.
THANK YOU.
DR, Mobin Mohammadi
